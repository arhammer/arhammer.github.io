				<h3>Kristin Yvonne Rozier</h3>
				<h4>Abstract:</h4>
				<p>
				Advancement of AI-enhanced control in autonomous systems stands on the shoulders of formal methods, which make possible the rigorous safety analysis autonomous systems require.
				An aircraft cannot operate autonomously unless it has design-time reasoning to ensure correct operation of the autopilot and runtime reasoning to ensure system health management, or the ability to detect and respond to off-nominal situations.
				Formal methods are highly dependent on the specifications over which they reason; there is no escaping the “garbage in, garbage out” reality. Specification is difficult, unglamorous, and arguably the biggest bottleneck facing verification and validation of aerospace, and other, autonomous systems.
				</p>
				<p>
				This VSTTE invited talk and paper examines the outlook for the practice of formal specification, and highlights the on-going challenges of specification, from design-time to runtime system health management.
				We exemplify these challenges for specifications in Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) though the focus is not limited to that specification language.
				We pose challenge questions for specification that will shape both the future of formal methods, and our ability to more automatically verify and validate autonomous systems of greater variety and scale. We call for further research into LTL Genesis.

				<h2><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10207-018-0424-2">Breaking MPC implementations through compression</a></h2>
				<h3>João S. Resende, Patrícia R. Sousa, Rolando Martins & Luís Antunes </h3>
				<h4>Abstract:</h4>
				<p>
				There are many cryptographic protocols in the literature that are scientifically and mathematically sound.
				By extension, cryptography today seeks to respond to numerous properties of the communication process beyond confidentiality (secrecy), such as integrity, authenticity, and anonymity.
				In addition to the theoretical evidence, implementations must be equally secure.
				Due to the ever-increasing intrusion from governments and other groups, citizens are now seeking alternatives ways of communication that do not leak information.
				In this paper, we analyze multiparty computation (MPC), which is a sub-field of cryptography with the goal of creating methods for parties to jointly compute a function over their inputs while keeping those inputs private.
				This is a very useful method that can be used, for example, to carry out computations on anonymous data without having to leak that data.
				Thus, due to the importance of confidentiality in this type of technique, we analyze active and passive attacks using complexity measures (compression and entropy).
				We start by obtaining network traces and syscalls, then we analyze them using compression and entropy techniques.
				Finally, we cluster the traces and syscalls using standard clustering techniques.
				This approach does not need any deep specific knowledge of the implementations being analyzed. This paper presents a security analysis for four MPC frameworks, where three were identified as insecure.
				These insecure libraries leak information about the inputs provided by each party of the communication.
				Additionally, we have detected, through a careful analysis of its source code, that SPDZ-2’s secret sharing schema always produces the same results.
