				<h2>Computation of the Recoverability of Systems at Design Time</h2>
				<h4>Andy Hammer, Eunsuk Kang</h4>
				<h5>model checking, recoverability, computation tree logic</h5>
				<p>
				Many software systems are not verified because it is expensive – both financially and temporally – to show a system is 100% correct.
				Additionally, many systems do not need total correctness; some systems may tolerate property violations as long as they eventually recover.
				If a property requires that an invariant holds at all times during execution, it may be more important for the system to recover from the invariant violation than for the violation itself to be removed.
				We analyze systems to compute their recoverability – if an invariant is violated in the system, is it possible to return to a safe state from that violation.
				Addtionally, we examine different categorizations of recovery; if an invariant is violated multiple times, it may be possible to return to a safe state after some violations, but not others.
				The actions required to return to safety are also in question, especially if some actions require human intervention to return to safety.
				A system that can always recover from an invariant violation may be less safe than a completely correct system, but we explore the possibility that it is easier to guarantee recoverability than correctness of a system.

				<h2>Trust Boundary and Graceful Degradation of EV Charging Stations</h2>
				<h4>Vick Dini, Changjian Zhang, Andy Hammer, Ryan Wagner, Eunsuk Kang, David Garlan, Kshitiz Kshitiz, Muhammad Mazaya</h4>
				<h5>formal verification, electric vehicles, software architecture, graceful degredation, trust boundary</h5>
				<p>
				Unpredictable changes to the environment of a cyber-physical system introduce the potential for unsafe operating conditions.
				Should components of an architecture be subject to cyber attacks, hardware failures, or adverse environmental conditions, it is important the safety-critical features still be functional to avoid dangerous conditions for users.
				<em>Graceful degradation</em> refers to systems where some components may experience failure, but the system maintains safety-critical features.
				The <em>trust boundry</em> of a system refers to the minimal set of components required before safety-critical features are sacrificed.
				Identifying trust boundaries and building systems with graceful degradation allow systems to prioritize select components to maintain safety, instead of focusing on all components.
				</p>
				<p>
				We examine charging stations for electric vehicles as a case study on graceful degradation and trust boundries.
				EV charging station have a large, modular architecture with a minimal interaction between local stations.
				Identifying the trust boundry for this system can show that graceful degradtion is applicable to real world systems and provides details of improvement regions to fulfillment of safety-critical requirements.

				<h2>Verification of Secure Multiparty Computation Deployments with Domain Context</h2>
				<h4>Andy Hammer, Eunsuk Kang, Fraser Brown</h4>
				<h5>formal verification, secure multiparty computation</h5>
				<p>
				Secure multiparty computation (MPC) is a cryptographic process that allows for mathematical computation over masked and unknown inputs.
				MPC deployments are used in a variety of areas, including medical and economic research, as well as cryptocurrencies and digital key wallets.
				However, many MPC implementation (including those implemented by MPC cryptographers) have security gaps and bugs.
				Even when implementations are theoretically secure, they can still be crippled by the domain they are deployed in - the context of the deployment as well the hardware infrastructure the computation runs on.
				While there has been much work in proving theoretical MPC protocols, as well as formal models for MPC compillers, there is little work in formally verifying MPC.
				In this work, we create formal models of different MPC protocols, and include the hardware infrastructure context within the model to identify security vulnerabilities.
				This allows for identification of security vulnerabilities that exist due to hardware configurations that cannot be reasoned about during cryptographic proofs.
